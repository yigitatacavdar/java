                <p style="font-size:120%">When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he
                    would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with
                    a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and
                    excitement in Hobbiton.
                    Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the
                    wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable
                    disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had
                    brought back from his travels had now become a local legend,
                    and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might
                    say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with
                    treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also
                    his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it
                    seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was
                    much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call
                    him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the
                    mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought
                    this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that
                    anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well
                    as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
                    ‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and
                    trouble will come of it!’</p>
